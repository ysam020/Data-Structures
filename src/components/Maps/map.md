## Maps

1. A map is an unordered collection of key-value pairs. Both keys and values can be of any data type.
2. To retrieve a value, you can use the corresponding key.
3. Maps are iterables. They can be used with a for-of loop.

## Maps vs Objects

| ###Maps                                                    | ###Objects                                                   |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Maps are ordered                                           | Objects are unordered                                        |
| Keys in maps can be of any data type                       | Keys in objects can only be strings                          |
| Maps do have any keys by default                           | Objects have prototypes and may contain default keys         |
| Maps are iterables                                         | Objects are not iterables                                    |
| Numbers of items in map can be determined by size property | Number of items are determined manually                      |
| Maps can only store data                                   | You can add functionality to objects apart from storing data |
