## Sets

1. A set is a data structure that can hold a collection of values. The values, however must be unique.
2. Sets can contain a mix of different data types. You can store string, numbers, booleans, or even objects in a same set.
3. Sets are dynamically sized. You don't have to declare the size of a set before creating it.
4. Sets do not maintain an insertion order. An item inserted first does not necessarily mean is the first element in the set.
5. Sets are iterables, i.e. they can be used with a for-of loop.

## Sets vs Arrays

| Sets                                         | Arrays                                     |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Can not contain duplicate values             | Can contain duplicate values               |
| Insertion order is not maintained            | Insertion order is maintained              |
| Searching and deletion is faster than arrays | Searching and deletion is slower than sets |
