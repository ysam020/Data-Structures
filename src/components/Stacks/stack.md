## Stacks

1. Stack data structure is a sequential collection of elements that follows the principle of Last In First Out (LIFO).
2. The last element inserted into the stack is the first element to be removed.
3. Stack is an abstract data type. It is defined by its behaviour rather than being a mathematical model
4. Stack data structure supports two main operations
   - Push: add an element to the collection
   - Pop: removes the most recently added element from the collection
